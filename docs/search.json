    "section": "",
    "text": "For anybody who makes tons of flowcharts, mermaid.js may be the siren song that draws you to Quarto.\nThe Quarto’s documentation and functionality is extremely robust, so there are bound to be pieces we’ve all missed. The built-in mermaid.js functionality is quickly growing into a can’t-miss feature for me and likely anybody who spends a lot of time creating flowcharts – hi other healthcare folx!\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A((Can I <br> have pizza?))\n  A --> B{What time <br> of day is it?} \n  B --> C(Morning)\n  B --> D(Evening)\n  B --> E(Supper Time)\n  C --> F{Is said pizza <br> on a bagel?}\n  D --> F\n  E --> F\n  F -->|Yes| G[YOU CAN EAT <br> PIZZA <br> ANYTIME!]\n  F -->|NO| H[NO PIZZA <br> FOR YOU!]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are inputs for almost every tweak you could think of making: shape, color, line type, subgroup, etc.\nAnd it’s not just flowcharts you can make with mermaid. They’ve got sequence diagrams, user journey diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, git graphs that look like Metro rail maps, and Gantt diagrams, aka swimlane diagrams in healthcare parlance.\nUnfortunately some of those formats are a hit-and-miss with properly rendering in Quarto at the moment (at least for me). We’re not going to talk about the two hours I just lost trying to get a swimlane chart to show at the proper width.\nLet’s take a look at what’s behind a couple samples I was able to get to work:\n\n```{mermaid}\nclassDiagram\n    Animal <|-- Duck\n    Animal <|-- Fish\n    Animal <|-- Zebra\n    Animal : +int age\n    Animal : +String gender\n    Animal: +isMammal()\n    Animal: +mate()\n    class Duck{\n      +String beakColor\n      +swim()\n      +quack()\n    }\n    class Fish{\n      -int sizeInFeet\n      -canEat()\n    }\n    class Zebra{\n      +bool is_wild\n      +run()\n    }\n```\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n    Animal <|-- Duck\n    Animal <|-- Fish\n    Animal <|-- Zebra\n    Animal : +int age\n    Animal : +String gender\n    Animal: +isMammal()\n    Animal: +mate()\n    class Duck{\n      +String beakColor\n      +swim()\n      +quack()\n    }\n    class Fish{\n      -int sizeInFeet\n      -canEat()\n    }\n    class Zebra{\n      +bool is_wild\n      +run()\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample via Mermaid Live\nI highly recommend using Mermaid Live for a WYSIWYG look at your changes on the fly. However, I don’t copy their specific Markdown output. Instead I just copy what I’ve been tweaking into a new Quarto mermaid block.\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\nA[Patient has <br> acute symptoms] --> B{Triage in ER: <br> Evidence of MI?}\nB --> |Yes| C[Early anti-ischemia <br> /infarction therapy]\nB --> |No| D[Ambulatory care: <br> Initial evaluation]\nC --> E[Inpatient evaluation <br> and therapy]\nC --> F[Ambulatory care: <br> Follow-up care]\nF --> G{Invasive <br> evaluation done?}\nG --> |No| H[Ambulatory care: <br> Rehab and follow-up]\nG --> |Yes| I{Procedure <br> initiated?}\nI --> |No| H\nI --> |Yes| J[Revascularization <br> procedure]\nJ --> H\n```\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\nA[Patient has <br> acute symptoms] --> B{Triage in ER: <br> Evidence of MI?}\nB --> |Yes| C[Early anti-ischemia <br> /infarction therapy]\nB --> |No| D[Ambulatory care: <br> Initial evaluation]\nC --> E[Inpatient evaluation <br> and therapy]\nC --> F[Ambulatory care: <br> Follow-up care]\nF --> G{Invasive <br> evaluation done?}\nG --> |No| H[Ambulatory care: <br> Rehab and follow-up]\nG --> |Yes| I{Procedure <br> initiated?}\nI --> |No| H\nI --> |Yes| J[Revascularization <br> procedure]\nJ --> H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample adapted from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Quality Improvement Essentials Toolkit\nEven with all the hiccups of mermaid and Quarto not playing nice together, I think this can be a huge boon in my workday, and that of many others I imagine."

    "text": "Ask anybody who has worked with me, they’ll tell you I’m the king of underpromising then overdelivering.\nI’m hoping that turns out to be the case with this shiny new Quarto portfolio site and blog I built.1\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is what I’m hoping to accomplish:\nWatch one, do one, teach one: I’m cribbing this mentality from the talented nurses I spend my workday serving. I began learning R back in 2018 as part of my Business Analytics master’s program. With a few years of experience under my belt, it’s time to pay forward what I learned from those a few steps ahead of me then.\nGet some healthcare example cases out there: Maybe I’m just looking in the wrong places, but it’s hard to find direct parallels to things I’m doing around the hospital online. That likely has to do with HIPAA hurdles. But I’m going to start looking for some available mock hospital data and putting together some work with those to give people interested in a healthcare data career a taste of what they can expect. So if you know of any mock hospital data OK for blogging examples with, let me know. Otherwise, I’ll be digging into charlatan to try my hand at creating my own fake dataset.\nLearn what other R folks are up to: Although I’ve changed industries, I’m still a journalist at heart. One thing I’d love to do is interview other R users about what they’re working on, either professionally or as a hobby. I foresee a rich vein of inspiration – for others as well as myself. Think of it as a podcast, but in writing.\nBeing a full-time employee and full-time grad student will definitely challenge how often I can post, but I’ll look for opportunities where available.\nLet’s have some fun!\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nAlbert Rapp’s guide was super helpful↩︎"
