For anybody who makes tons of flowcharts, [mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) may be the siren song that draws you to Quarto.

The [Quarto's documentation and functionality is extremely robust](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/), so there are bound to be pieces we've all missed. The built-in mermaid.js functionality is quickly growing into a can't-miss feature for me and likely anybody who spends a lot of time creating flowcharts -- hi other healthcare folx!

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A((Can I <br> have pizza?))
  A --> B{What time <br> of day is it?} 
  B --> C(Morning)
  B --> D(Evening)
  B --> E(Supper Time)
  C --> F{Is said pizza <br> on a bagel?}
  D --> F
  E --> F
  F -->|Yes| G[YOU CAN EAT <br> PIZZA <br> ANYTIME!]
  F -->|NO| H[NO PIZZA <br> FOR YOU!]
```

There are [inputs for almost every tweak](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart) you could think of making: shape, color, line type, subgroup, etc.

And it's not just flowcharts you can make with mermaid. They've got sequence diagrams, user journey diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, git graphs that look like Metro rail maps, and Gantt diagrams, aka swimlane diagrams in healthcare parlance.

Let's take a look at what's behind a couple samples I was able to get to work:

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: fenced
classDiagram
    Animal <|-- Duck
    Animal <|-- Fish
    Animal <|-- Zebra
    Animal : +int age
    Animal : +String gender
    Animal: +isMammal()
    Animal: +mate()
    class Duck{
      +String beakColor
      +swim()
      +quack()
    }
    class Fish{
      -int sizeInFeet
      -canEat()
    }
    class Zebra{
      +bool is_wild
      +run()
    }
```

I highly recommend using [Mermaid Live](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNptkU1PwzAMhv9KlBOI9Q9UuyC2SRx22m2KhNzEdFbzAfnQBKP_nbSlYXT4ZD-OX72xL1w6hbzmUkMIG4LWgxGW5Xi0ZECz9VdVsU2S3S3dUTjd0iM2Hv7gmj2QjQxaXOJD9GRb1qJV6K-bw0jYg8np3f2iYSDiDEfbo73LBFgRbRC6J6edL41wJjMP5vI9gezmur_WGz5W9KrBe6BPfLY7xFiwBLuF-O_8uIJfQ41zmlF4OZNWBfpkF7Nz8BU36A2QyncZVQSPJzQoeJ1Tha-QdBRc2D4_TW8q72OrKDrP6-gTrjik6A4fVs719ObnuhPsvwES3pny) for a WYSIWYG look at your changes on the fly. However, I don't copy their specific Markdown output. Instead I just copy what I've been tweaking into a new Quarto mermaid block.

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: fenced

A[Patient has <br> acute symptoms] --> B{Triage in ER: <br> Evidence of MI?}
B --> |Yes| C[Early anti-ischemia <br> /infarction therapy]
B --> |No| D[Ambulatory care: <br> Initial evaluation]
C --> E[Inpatient evaluation <br> and therapy]
C --> F[Ambulatory care: <br> Follow-up care]
F --> G{Invasive <br> evaluation done?}
G --> |No| H[Ambulatory care: <br> Rehab and follow-up]
G --> |Yes| I{Procedure <br> initiated?}

I --> |Yes| J[Revascularization <br> procedure]
J --> H
```

Even with all the hiccups of mermaid and Quarto not playing nice together, I think this can be a huge boon in my workday, and that of many others I imagine.
